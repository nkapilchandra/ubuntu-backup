I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras which is one of the top institutions in my country and I have enrolled into a full time program. Since it is a full time program most of my time is spent finishing my course work here and I have no time to work and earn for myself. Being at an elite institute I have to spend a considerable amount of time on the course work to compete with bright students from all over the country. I am currently availing a loan to pay for tuition fees and apart from that I also have to pay for food and hostel accommodation as well. All of this amounts to a lot of financial burden. After graduation I am planning on pursuing master's degree as well for which I have to take a loan again. Coming from a middle class family getting a degree from an elite institution puts financial pressure on the family. Doing this course is very important for my future and getting a financial is the only way I can do the course.





I am already availing a loan for my education and since I am planning on pursuing masters degree in the future I have to take another loan. Currently it is extremely difficult for me to pay for the course since I am not earning anything as I have enrolled into a full time program. However, I am willing to contribute to Coursera community after getting a job after my education.
